# Project Description

This Python project is a GUI-based Internet Speed Test App built using Tkinter and Speedtest modules.
It measures your ping, download, and upload speeds in real-time, and displays results in a clean, modern interface.
Users can copy results, clear data, and view detailed server info â€” all from within the app.
The app runs speed tests on a separate thread to keep the interface smooth and responsive.
